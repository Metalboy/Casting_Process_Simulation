# Casting_Process_Simulation

A major part of my PhD research was focusing on Integrated Computational Materials Engineering, where I developed my compuational experience with a combination of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for process simulation, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for product development and Calculation of Phase Diagram (CALPHAD) for materials modeling.

Most importantly, I found the Finite Element Method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) very similar to the statistical learning process, where we generally start with a base model, design some metrics to evaluate the modeling results, and further tweak hyperparameters or feature engineering to improve the model. Such experience has become my early exposure to deal with big data, especially when I used Python to write sub-routines and MATLAB for data post-processing and visualization.

To give an example, I included two powerpoints about two different casting process simulation, which are 
* HPDC Simulation.pptx, where HPDC stands for High Pressure Die Casting process, and 
* LPDC Simulation.pptx, where LPDC stands for Low Pressure Die Casting process. 
In both cases, Solidworks was used to draw the CAD file and ProCAST was employed for FEA.
