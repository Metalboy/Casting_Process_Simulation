# Casting_Process_Simulation

A major part of my PhD research was focusing on Integrated Computational Materials Engineering, where I developed my computational experience with a combination of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for process simulation, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for product development and Calculation of Phase Diagram (CALPHAD) for materials modeling.

Most importantly, I found the Finite Element Method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) very similar to the statistical learning process, where we generally start with a base model, design some metrics to evaluate the modeling results, and further tweak hyperparameters or feature engineering to improve the model. Such experience has become my early exposure to deal with big data. Specifically, my research has involved the following items

* tested different hypotheses and designed corresponding metrics to evaluate simulation results
* wrote Python for user-defined subroutines to calculate multi-physics phenomena and used MATLAB to extract and transform multi-GB datasets for post-processing
* designed multiple experiments and implemented them to validate the predictions
* communicated results with peers, presented them in conferences and published them on top journals

To give an example, I included two powerpoints about two different casting process simulation in this repository, which are 
* HPDC Simulation.pptx, where HPDC stands for High Pressure Die Casting process, and 
* LPDC Simulation.pptx, where LPDC stands for Low Pressure Die Casting process.
In both cases, Solidworks was used to draw the CAD file and ProCAST was employed for FEA.
